# SMVDU Login

Firstly we will need the selenium web driver which will be automatically installed from the login.sh scipt.

This is a code written to login automatically to SOFOS.

You will have to clone the repo with the ` git clone https://github.com/Shivanshu97i/SMVDU-Login.git` command.

Then go in to the cloned directory, open a terminal there and run a simple command to make the login.sh file executable `chmod +x login.sh`

And also run `pwd` command and copy the response using ctrl+shift+c.

Then run `./login.sh` it will prompt a nano window you will have to replace just the path/to/ with the copied response using ctrl+v.

Press `ctrl+o` then enter to save the changes then `ctrl+x`.

Now just one last step you will have to add your credentials in the login.py file that you cloned. 

 Voila!!No need to login.
 
 Works for Ubuntu and its distros.
