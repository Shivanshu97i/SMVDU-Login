# SMVDU Login

Firstly we will need the selenium web driver which will be automatically installed from the login.sh scipt.

This is a code written to login automatically to SOFOS.

You will have to clone the repo with the ` git clone https://github.com/Shivanshu97i/SMVDU-Login.git` command.

Run this to cd in to the cloned directory `cd SMVDU-Login/`

Run a simple command to make the login.sh file executable `chmod +x login.sh`

Run Script `./login.sh`

Now just one last step you will have to add your credentials in the login.py file that you cloned. 

Voila!!No need to login.
 
Works for Ubuntu and its distros.
